Unlike Valheim Vanilla you´ll now have the opportunity to explore and experiment with different types of gear, enchanting and augments.
Gear & Progression
Instead of just a linear upgrading scale of armor and weapons you now have to plan strategically what kind of weapon you should use against what. How so, you ask? Well unlike Vanilla, in Reloaded you´ll face different kinds of monster with different abilities.

# New Monsters and Variants of Monsters

The monsters can have various degrees of stars and damage infused by either poison, fire, frost, spirit or chaos. And this is what makes Reloaded so much more fun, you´ll never know what to expect.
